9 weeks into the Mayden bootcamp, decided to have a go re-doing my online portfolio. I used gulp to manage SASS and Babel, SASS auto-prefixer to automate prefixing when compiling, handlebars and JS to dynamically display my projects from a local JSON file and chart.js to help illustrated my confidence and skill with the given tools picked up at the 16 week Bootcamp.
